Online recreative performed in android with java, include the design pattern MVVM (Model View ViewModel), and in this project, I have used Firebase to logIn and register with a  Firebase Firestore,  email verification and phone verification, realtime database to set comments in real time, Firebase Storage to save userprofile images and product images and finally I have used Firebase Machine Learning to extract text from an image and validate a DNI.
The app use two kind of ads, Rewarded ads which you can use to get balance in the app, and banner apps which shows publi about something.
